This is a mobile application written in Kotlin, in Android Studio, for the course Mobile Apps Development. This project was developed in 4 phases (spirals). 

For the first refactor, I designed a simple UI and used intents to achieve the desired funcionality (browsing the list of games and checking out the details of a game chosen from the list). 

For the second refactor, I utilised fragments and navigation components instead
of intents. 

When it comes to spiral 3, instead of using a static list of games, I used two APIs (one of them is Twitch, and the other one was designed specifically for this course). The first API
supplied me with the list of games, and the second one with user account. 

And finally, in spiral 4, I added Room to create a database where user impressions of a certain game were stored and displayed when appropriate. 

For anyone interested in seeing spiral 1 and spiral 2, this was my working repository with these versions: https://github.com/AHromic1/Games-Mobile-Application.git .
